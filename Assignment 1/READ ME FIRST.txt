For part 2 of the assignment there are 2 scripts:


Script 1 uses bug number to download the bugs as for the given url there are 50 bugs in total with list starting from 201-251, thus bug_start = 201 and bug_end = 251(max)

script 1 = get_atlassian_bugs.py 
config for script 1 = bug_conf

Script 2

script 2 use the index value from the list thus you can download bugs by just entering range of bugs you want to download eg:0-5...0-10...etc with bug_start = 0 (min index value) and bug_end = 49 (max index value) 

script 2 = get_atlassian_bugs1.py
config for script 2 = bug_conf1
